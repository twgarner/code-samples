/*This is an example problem from hackerrank.com
The first line of input that is read is the number of test cases for the game
Each line after that is the number of stones used for that test case
Each "Player" is trying to win by forcing the other player to not be able to make a move
Each turn the Player removes 2,3, or 5 stones from the board until there are no more moves left to be made
The Player loses if they can not remove any stones from the board*/
